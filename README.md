### Cards distribution

From the shuffled deck, the dealear deals the player two cards and finally takes only one card, European style. 
Once the distribution is over, the player chooses whether to draw another card (+) or stop (-). 

Once the player has decided to stop, it is up to the dealer to draw, the latter does not stop until he has drawn or passed the player.

### The result
At the end of the game there are three possibilities: 
- When the dealer "busts", that is, exceeds the maximum limit of 21 and consequently the player win the double of the initial bet.
- When the player "busts" or is passed by the dealer. The player loses all the initial bet.
- When the player and the dealer get the same score without "getting high". The initial bet is refunded.
